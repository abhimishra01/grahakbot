## AI PROVIDER STANDARD
Support three providers:
- Anthropic Claude (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) default
- OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini)
- Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash)

API key resolution:
1. import.meta.env.VITE_X_API_KEY → green Dev Mode badge
2. localStorage → skip prompt
3. Show inline key input in demo section

Show provider selector + cost per message:
- Claude: ~$0.001 / message
- OpenAI: ~$0.0005 / message
- Gemini: Free tier

---

## src/utils/systemPrompt.js
Build a function buildSystemPrompt(config) that
takes a config object and returns a system prompt:

config shape:
{
  businessName: string,
  businessType: string,
  services: string[],
  hours: string,
  location: string,
  tone: 'friendly' | 'professional' | 'casual'
}

The prompt must:
- Set the AI as a customer assistant for that business
- List the services, hours, location
- Set tone based on selection
- Instruct replies to be 1-3 sentences max
- Sound like a real WhatsApp message
- Never mention being an AI unless directly asked
- Handle orders, appointments, FAQs, pricing queries
- Politely decline anything outside business scope

---

## src/utils/aiClient.js
Multi-provider client identical to project standard.
Single function: sendMessage(messages, config)
where messages is the full conversation history array
and config has providerKey and apiKey.

Each provider call passes:
- System prompt from buildSystemPrompt()
- Full conversation history for context
- Max tokens: 150 (keep replies short like WhatsApp)
- Try/catch with meaningful error messages

---

## src/data/starterMessages.js
Export an object with starter messages per
business type. When user selects a business type
in the customizer, preload the chat with a
relevant opening customer message.

Example:
restaurant: "Hi, do you have tables available
  for 4 people tonight at 8pm?"
salon: "Hello, I wanted to book a haircut for
  tomorrow. What slots are available?"
retail: "Hi, do you have blue running shoes
  in size 9?"
ca: "I need help filing my GST returns this
  month. Can you guide me?"
coaching: "I want to enroll my child for
  Math classes. What are the fees?"
clinic: "I need to book an appointment with
  the doctor for tomorrow morning."

---

## src/data/useCases.js
Export array of 6 use case objects:
Each has: icon, title, description, exampleQ, exampleA

Restaurant, Salon, Retail Shop,
CA/Accountant, Coaching Centre, Medical Clinic
